		<Overview>Thanks to his police officer father's efforts, Shawn Spencer spent his childhood developing a keen eye for detail (and a lasting dislike of his dad). Years later, Shawn's frequent tips to the police lead to him being falsely accused of a
			crime he solved. Now, Shawn has no choice but to use his abilities to perpetuate his cover story: psychic crime-solving powers, all the while dragging his best friend, his dad, and the police along for the ride.</Overview>

		<SeriesName>Outrageous Acts of Psych</SeriesName>
		<Overview>Outrageous Acts of Psych takes the hidden-camera phenomenon to the next level. Stemming from the hit Science Channel series, Outrageous Acts of Science, OAP uses hidden cameras to show whether people will pay for a VIP experience at a bus
			stop or a laundromat, or whether men or women are more likely to take a food sample from a person wearing a hazmat suit. Throughout the show, psychologists and human behavior experts offer insights into why we do the things we do.</Overview>
